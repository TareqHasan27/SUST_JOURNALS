  abstract: "Climate change represents one of the most pressing challenges of our time, requiring accurate prediction models to inform policy decisions and mitigation strategies. This comprehensive review examines the application of machine learning approaches in climate change prediction, analyzing their effectiveness, limitations, and future potential. We systematically review recent advances in neural networks, ensemble methods, and hybrid models, discussing their performance in various climate prediction tasks.",
